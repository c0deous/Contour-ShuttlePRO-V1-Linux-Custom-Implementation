This is a very basic driver implementation for the Contour Design ShuttlePRO V1.
I found one lying around and decided to fiddle with it - this is the result.

To customize to your liking you will need to know python.  Just replace the lines that print which button was pressed with your desired function.

Dependencies: python-evdev (for USB support)
